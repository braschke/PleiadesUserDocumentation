## Pleiades Acknowledgement
Our suggested wording for an Pleiades acknowledgement in your paper is:

   > The computations were carried out on the Pleiades cluster at the University of Wuppertal, which was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and the Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF).
