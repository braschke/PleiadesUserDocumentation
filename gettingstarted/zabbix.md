## Getting Started: Monitoring
Our monitoring service can be accessed at [zabbix.pleiades.uni-wuppertal.de](https://zabbix.pleiades.uni-wuppertal.de/) with the credentials "pleiades" and "pleiades".
Zabbix collects various information regarding current and past resource usage and quotas.

### Dashboard
After login you are typically greeted by the user dashboard:
[![Dashboard overview](../assets/img/zabbix/user_dashboard.jpg)](../assets/img/zabbix/user_dashboard.jpg)

There are also multiple sub-pages available, covering an overview and login-node-specific metrics:
[![Dashboard overview](../assets/img/zabbix/dashboard_pages.jpg)](../assets/img/zabbix/dashboard_pages.jpg)

The overview dashboard presents aggregated metrics and you can select the time frame of presented information on the top right.
The visible widgets are:
* Number of free (idle) worker or gpu nodes
* Current time
* **SLURM Allocated Cores by Group** (2 plots): Current allocation of Cores per group as reported by Slurm
* **Effective Share used by User Group**: Slurm CPU resource usage for each group (resets each month)
* **Effective Spare of GPU resources by User Group**: Slurm GPU resource usage for each group (resets each month)
* **Beegfs Group Quota** (% and TB): Information on how much space is available on BeeGFS per group

More detailed pages about each class of login nodes provide information about:
* **Number of logged in users**
* **CPU usage**
* **Memory usage**

You can change the displayed dashboard through `Monitoring > Dashboard > All dashboards > User dashboard`:

All available user dashboards are:

### GPU Dashboard
Another dashboard shows detailed information of all five gpu nodes, `gpu2100[1-5]`:
[![Dashboard overview](../assets/img/zabbix/gpu_dashboard.jpg)](../assets/img/zabbix/gpu_dashboard.jpg)

You can select separate pages for each gpu node, which provide detailed information:
[![Dashboard overview](../assets/img/zabbix/gpu_dashboard_detail.jpg)](../assets/img/zabbix/gpu_dashboard_detail.jpg)

These pages can help you answer questions like:
* How much memory is available on a specific GPU? (8 GPUs per node)
* How good is the utilization of a specific GPU?
* How busy is the node CPU or memory?
* How busy is the nodes network interface?
* How much power does the GPU consume?

If you know which GPUs your job is using, or if you use a whole node exclusively, this approach can help to assess your software performance.
